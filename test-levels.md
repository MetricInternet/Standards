\(_Unit/Small tests\)_

Testing Modules, components and classes in isolation with Test Coverage as close to 100% as possible.

#### Integration Testing

_\(Functional/Medium tests\)_

Testing that the submodules of the application integrate and communicate with each other in the way described by use-cases and system design.

#### End-to-End testing

_\(Scenario/Large tests\)_

---

### User Tests:

#### System testing

Testing the behaviour of the whole system/application in an** **environment should be as similar as possible to the production environment**.**

#### Acceptance testing

Testing by the clients or future users of an application  to establish confidence in the system, its parts, and its non-functional characteristics. e.g. alpha and beta tests. Alpha tests are performed on-site, but not by the development team. Beta tests are performed by a chosen group of potential customers at their own location.
